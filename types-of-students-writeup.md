# Types of Students - writeup

_Personae_  
****The paper from Otago University \(Smith et al., 2016\) is in general not something we can base our theory on. It is based on an approach of identifying personae \(Yström, Peterson, Sydow, & Malmqvist, 2010\)\(there are quite a bit other referencing in the paper, but they are not in the reference list\). The research extends on personae categories developed by marketing staff from Otago University.

The way personae are defined, is based on a matrix of competences. Thus, the personae categorisation is derived from a competence development perspective. The selection of competences in the article presents appears relevant, but a further justification is hard to find. However, in a Swedish research project, Yström et al. \(2010\) clearly link their choice of relevant competencies back to the learning outcomes in their curriculum, when personae categories are generated.

Smith et al. \(2016\), extend the number of personae's from the original 9 from the marketing research to 20 - which is not particularly useful. Out of those, they have only two international student profiles. Our student numbers and the diversity among them, especially in the Grad.Dip. programme would justify more profiles.

In conclusion, we can use this perspective if we make sure that we create our own, justified categories, based on justified competencies that we link back to in our learning outcomes. Also, we have to make sure that we reference solid research in the area.

_SOLO Taxonomy_  
This perspective is just initially represented with a couple of YouTube clips \(Brabrand, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c\). A justification for this perspective would require an examination of SOLO taxonomy and constructive alignment \(Biggs, 1987, 1996, 2011\). We can choose to extend on it - or not. The perspective and resources are fairly old, and not too different from the widely spread Blooms taxonomy. Difference is that Blooms taxonomy has three levels of increased complexity. SOLO has five levels \(where we want to reach the four top levels\) of increased reflection with the following processes:

1. Explain 
2. Relate 
3. Prove 
4. Apply 

Biggs \(1987, 1996, 2011\) combines this with the theory of constructive alignment, stating that the teachers intention,  must be aligned with the assessment structure to make the student's learning activity supported by the both the teachers intention and the assessment. The alignment must/can happen following the SOLO taxonomy.

The motivation for presenting them in this context is that Biggs \(1987, 1996, 2011\)  has this interesting split between teaching activity and assessment that we made in our course analysis. So we are taking this alignment for granted - to a large extent. Subsequently, have stated this as one factor in our other triangular model we created on the first day of research week: What we/the institution does - what the student does - and what technology we are applying.

Another motivation is that Biggs' perspective creates three levels of teaching styles \(from lowest to highest\) \(Brabrand, 2009c\).

 - What students are  
- What teachers do  
- What students do

Where we want to be in this picture, is that we are concerned with what students do but need to understand where they are in terms of competencies to be able to meet their demands and design learning activities building on where there are. In other words a non-judgement design process. I don't think Smith et al. \(2016\) manage to do that. They stay on the lowest teaching level.

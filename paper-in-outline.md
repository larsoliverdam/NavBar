## Designing for GIT in our courses - threads leading to a design based research assessment method for integrating new technology into ITP classrooms

### ABSTRACT

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Rationale, why this process is important

We posit as Information Technology \(IT\) tutors at New Zealand polytechnics, in response to a dynamic ICT landscape \(Lahey, 2005\), we continuously integrate new IT into our courses. Hence, as IT tutors we need a way to assess the utility of new technology in teaching and learning.   In this on-going practice the integration of "IT Tech"  into our courses \(as with courses from all disciplines\) can be seen from two perspectives - the pedagogic perspective and the content knowledge perspective, and a pedagogical content knowledge PCK \(Shulman, 1986\). The first perspective considers IT Tech as used for teaching and learning purposes. The second perspective considers the new IT Tech as it is used by the IT industry and hence it has become intrinsic to our course content. PCK alerts us to the effect of pedagogical content knowledge that has the potential to derive a suitable path for teaching and learning. A useful framework that extends Shulman's PCK to include technology is "technological pedagogical content knowledge" \(TPACK\) described by Mishra and Koehler \(2006\) in which they introduce technological considerations into the frame.  Constructive Alignment  \(CA\) \(SOLO quote\) is undercurrent in the design of our courses with the intention that course assessment is well aligned with learning outcomes and in their delivery. 



We report on the discovery of a new way to integrate IT technology into our courses by deploying Hybrid Design  Based Research Agile Software Development \(hDAS\). 

In this  first stage of a Design Based Research into the integration of Git and GitHUB \( \) as a tool for  teaching and learning in courses offered in Computer Graphics Imagery and Information Technology at a New Zealand polytechnic.

#### 1.3 GIT and GitHub

Version control systems like Git combined with hosting services like GitHub are playing a vital role in the education of  universities and institutes students, With these both tools have evolved to serve the educational sector needs. Tutors in both spaces of class locally  and remotely can utilize and control a number of these technologies to distribute course materials and engage with their students, including tools such as Learning Management Systems\(LMS\) that are focused on education, other tools that can be created for different used in an educational context like social media platforms.

Git is a key factor tool to manage asynchronous and distributed software workflow, also it’s an important component of managing  resources and teamwork  in any software development environment. \[\]This led to to a demand upon tutors and to introduce Git to software development students and to preparing them for their future work environment and that by including version control systems in the courses. Git will help students with their software projects by organizing their workflow, team work and assign any specific task to any member in team.

#### 2.3 GITHUB

Github started originally as a social and workspace platform for software developers with tools that increase the collaboration between them. This platform is an encouragement to share their script work and also to give  feedback and support that can improve the work of others. So the base purpose for GitHub was for software developers but recently another use of the platform has emerged and to be more specific GitHub is being used and still using in education as a Learning Management System \(LMS\). The collaborative environment can be exploited in many ways in a course. 

According to its website, Git is a free open source version control system, clamming that’s easy to adopt and learn. It has a lighting fast performance and features that include branching, staging, allows multiply workflows and many more. Git was termed “the information manager from hell” by its creator, but although giving such a term to open source version control system there is no doubt that from Git is a well-engineered \(VCS\) what is capable of supporting  worldwide developers of software on a large scale.

### 4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

If we treat the polytechnic as a place of higher education \(HE\) similar to Universities, then we can argue that our students' perception on what works when IT as applied in teaching and learning is similar to the perception of students at Universities. Hence, a relevant student perception of "what works" as discovered by  Henderson, Selwyn, and Aston \( 2017, 1578\) tends towards logistical utility rather an enhancer of learning.

## Designing for GIT in our courses - threads leading to a design based research assessment method for integrating new technology into ITP classrooms

### ABSTRACT

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Rationale, why this process is important

We posit as Information Technology \(IT\) tutors at New Zealand polytechnics, in response to a dynamic ICT landscape \(Lahey, 2005\), we continuously integrate new IT into our courses. Hence, as IT tutors we need a way to assess the utility of new technology in teaching and learning.   In this on-going practice the integration of "IT Tech"  into our courses \(as with courses from all disciplines\) can be seen from two perspectives - the pedagogic perspective and the content knowledge perspective, and a pedagogical content knowledge PCK \(Shulman, 1986\). The first perspective considers IT Tech as used for teaching and learning purposes. The second perspective considers the new IT Tech as it is used by the IT industry and hence it has become intrinsic to our course content. PCK alerts us to the effect of pedagogical content knowledge that has the potential to derive a suitable path for teaching and learning. A useful framework that extends Shulman's PCK to include technology is "technological pedagogical content knowledge" \(TPACK\) described by Mishra and Koehler \(2006\) in which they introduce technological considerations into the frame.  Constructive Alignment  \(CA\) \(SOLO quote\) is undercurrent in the design of our courses with the intention that course assessment is well aligned with learning outcomes and in their delivery. 



We report on the discovery of a new way to integrate IT technology into our courses by deploying Hybrid Design  Based Research Agile Software Development \(hDAS\). 

In this  first stage of a Design Based Research into the integration of Git and GitHUB \( \) as a tool for  teaching and learning in courses offered in Computer Graphics Imagery and Information Technology at a New Zealand polytechnic.

#### 1.3 GIT and GitHub

Version control systems like Git combined with hosting services like GitHub are playing a vital role in the education of  universities and institutes students, With these both tools have evolved to serve the educational sector needs. Tutors in both spaces of class locally  and remotely can utilize and control a number of these technologies to distribute course materials and engage with their students, including tools such as Learning Management Systems\(LMS\) that are focused on education, other tools that can be created for different used in an educational context like social media platforms.

### 4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION

If we treat the polytechnic as a place of higher education \(HE\) similar to Universities, then we can argue that our students' perception on what works when IT as applied in teaching and learning is similar to the perception of students at Universities. Hence, a relevant student perception of "what works" as discovered by  Henderson, Selwyn, and Aston \( 2017, 1578\) tends towards logistical utility rather an enhancer of learning.
